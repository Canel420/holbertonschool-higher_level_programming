# 0x05-python-exceptions
Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. 
Two types of Error occurs in python:
* Syntax errors.
* Logical errors (Exceptions).

## Try Except in Python
Try and Except statement is used to handle these errors within our code in Python. The try block is used to check some code for errors i.e the code inside the try block will execute when there is no error in the program. Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceding try block.

## Syntax
```
try:
    # Some Code
except:
    # Executed if error in the
    # try block
```
