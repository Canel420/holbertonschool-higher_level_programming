# 0x06-python-classes
Python classes are part of a programming paradigm called object oriented programming.

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. Is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on.

**Classes** and **objects** are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.
